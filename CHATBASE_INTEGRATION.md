# Chatbase AI Integration

## Status: ✅ INTEGRATED

Your Chatbase AI has been successfully integrated into the Raahi app with your Agent ID: `hsQKeM8HRconRfdAMHuSf`

## How to Test

1. **Open the app** and navigate to the hamburger menu
2. **Select "AI Assistant"** from the menu
3. **Send a message** to test the integration
4. **Check the console logs** to see which API endpoint works

## Integration Details

### API Endpoints Tested
The integration tries multiple potential Chatbase API endpoints:
- `https://www.chatbase.co/api/v1/chat`
- `https://api.chatbase.co/chat` 
- `https://chatbase.co/api/chat`
- `https://www.chatbase.co/api/chat`

### Request Format
```json
{
  "agentId": "hsQKeM8HRconRfdAMHuSf",
  "message": "user message here",
  "stream": false
}
```

### Fallback System
- If Chatbase API is unavailable, the app falls back to intelligent mock responses
- This ensures your app always works even if there are API issues

## Console Monitoring

When testing, watch the console for these messages:
- ✅ `Success with endpoint: [URL]` - Chatbase is working
- ❌ `Endpoint not found: [URL]` - That endpoint doesn't exist
- ⚠️ `All Chatbase endpoints failed, using mock response` - API issues

## Next Steps

1. **Test the integration** by sending messages in the AI chat
2. **Monitor the console logs** to see which endpoint succeeds
3. **If needed**, we can adjust the API format based on the actual Chatbase API documentation
